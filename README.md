# CSE-PROJECT-1

# About the repository
This repository has been created for the purpose of backing up a school computer science project online. 
<br/><br/>
I am not planning on accepting any pull requests until this assignment is due on 17/05/2019. However, feel free to use my code in your own software as per the MIT License of course.
<br/><br/>
I have used tags to label the working versions of the code, these will be the least buggy. 
<br/><br/>
I highly reccomend, if you care for the development of the game, that you test my code and provide your feedback via this Google Form https://forms.gle/kWnM8tDgUyhxNsPy6. 

# About the game
The purpose of the project is to create text based role playing game. My code in particular, is a choose-your-own text adventure game, similar to that of Zork or The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy Game.
<br/><br/>
The game is based in a fantasy world similar to that of books and movies such as Game of Thrones and Lord of the Rings. You play as the character Bilbo, who has recently been kicked out of the inn he had been staying at. He is nearly broke, but then recieves a letter from a friend Baern telling him that he needs help with a job in the town of Sharnwick. 

# How to install
To install this game you will require the windows application Visual Studio.
Step One
<br/>
Navigate to the releases of the repository and choose the latest version for the least bugs and most features. 
<br/><br/>
Step Two
<br/>
Download the release in your preferred compressed format and extract the files.
<br/><br/>
Step Three
<br/>
Open the Project1.sln file with Visual Studio and click the green arrow, or start to play the game.

# How to play the game
The controls of the game should be self explanatory, you required to read any instructions before you play the game. Just in case you get stuck here is how you play the game
<br/><br/>
When asked something like "Pick an option." or "What do you do next?" Type the letter that is adjacent to the action you want to do and press enter. If you provide an invalid answer, nothing will happen except that you will be asked the same question again.
<br/><br/>
When you read [Press any key to continue] just press any key, the key you press will not impact the game. 
<br/><br/>
Finally if you are having difficulty exiting the software, all you need to do is press "Ctrl" and "c" at the same time.
