# About the repository
This repository is the development repository for the role playing game The Smith's Stash. As I am using this repository as I develop the project, likely there will be bugs and code may not compile or run. I have used tags to label the working versions of the code, these will be the least buggy. I highly reccomend that you test my code and provide your feedback via this Google Form __LINK_COMING_SOON__, as it will help guide the development of my project. Finally, I have chosen to make my project open source, so I encourage you to use my code in your own projects as per the MIT Licence included.

# About the game

You play as the character Bilbo, who has recently been kicked out of the inn he has been staying at. He is nearly broke, but then recieves a letter from a friend Baern telling him that he needs help with a job in the town of Sharnwick.
