# CSE-PROJECT-1-DEV

This repository is the development repository for the role playing game The Smith's Stash. As this is development repository, likely there will be bugs and code may not compile or run. Working beta releases can be found on the stable repository at https://github.com/1011776/CSE-PROJECT-1-STABLE. I have chosen to make my project open source, and I encourage you to use my code in your own projects as per the MIT Licence included.
